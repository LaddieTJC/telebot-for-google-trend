### Check your Google Chrome Version
I am using Selenium to scrape from Google Trend website and running it on headless mode. A chrome.exe file is needed according to your Google Chrome version. 

Here are the steps to check your Chrome Version:

1. Top right of your Google Chrome Browser click on the three vertical button.
2. Go to help and then click on About Google Chrome

The version is located beside the blue tick. In this case the version will be 111

Go to the following link to download the Chrome.exe for your Google Chrome browser:

- [Version 112](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=112.0.5615.28/)
- [Version 111](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=111.0.5563.64/)
- [Version 110](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=110.0.5481.77/)
